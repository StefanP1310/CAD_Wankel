The working profile is generated based on the parametric equation of the two-lobed epicycloid, using the dimensional parameters from the inner cylindrical gear that ensure the correct positioning of the rotor according to the eccentric shaft. 
An animation of the engine's operation has been made, along with another animation showing the exploded view of the assembly.
